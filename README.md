# Docker Containerized Restaurant Management App (C# .NETCore)
<ul>
  <li>A Docker Containerized Web Application that allows users to manage employees, dining tables, foods, orders and bills in the restaurant with authentication and role based authorization.</li>
  <li>The app was built with ASP.NET Core3.1 MVC with front-end Views created by Razor and Controllers implemented with Dependency Injection and Async/Await.</li>
  <li>Back-end data was managed by Microsoft SQL Server using Entity Framework Core (EF Core) and Dapper as Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for handling Authentication/Authorization data and the rest of the app data respectively.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>docker-compose defines 3 services: rmui, efcore-mssql and dapper-mssql. rmui packs an ASP.NET Core Web Application into RMUI container based on the image built by Dockerfile inside the RMUI folder. The efcore-mssql container is created by the mssql server that pulled from docker hub, which uses Entity Framework Core as ORM to manage the authentication/authorization data. The dapper-mssql container uses Dapper as ORM for managing the rest of the app data. It is created by the image rmdataimg, which is built in advance by dockerfile inside the RMDataBackup folder.</h3>
